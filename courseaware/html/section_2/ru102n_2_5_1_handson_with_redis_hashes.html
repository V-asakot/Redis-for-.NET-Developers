<h1>Hands on with Redis Hashes</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Redis Hashes from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <code>/src/section_2/section2.5/section2.5.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Collect and Clean out Keys</h2>

<p>
    In this example we'll be working with some pretty simple flat objects which we'll use hashes to organize. We'll be using three person
    hashes stored at the keys.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>person:1</li>
    <li>person:2</li>
    <li>person:3</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Before we get started with our example, we want to make sure that we remove these hashes so there isn't anything stale in Redis. Let's
    create keys for each of them and delete them.
</p>

<code>
    var person1 = "person:1";
    var person2 = "person:2";
    var person3 = "person:3";

    db.KeyDelete(new RedisKey[]{person1, person2, person3});
</code>

<h2>Create the Hashes</h2>

<p>
    Next, we'll want to create our three hashes, to create a hash, use the <code>HashSet</code> method, passing in an array of 
    <code>HashEntry</code> structs, which are simple key-value pairs.
</p>

<code>
    db.HashSet(person1, new HashEntry[]
    {
        new("name","Alice"),
        new("age", 33),
        new("email","alice@example.com")
    });

    db.HashSet(person2, new HashEntry[]
    {
        new("name","Bob"),
        new("age", 27),
        new("email","robert@example.com")
    });

    db.HashSet(person3, new HashEntry[]
    {
        new("name","Charlie"),
        new("age", 50),
        new("email","chuck@example.com")
    });
</code>

<h2>Increment a Field in a Hash</h2>

<p>
    Much like Redis Strings, you can increment fields in hashes. To Do this, use the <code>HashIncrement</code> method, passing in the incrementor
    you want to use. If you pass nothing in, it will increment by 1.
</p>

<code>
    var newAge = db.HashIncrement(person3, "age");
    Console.WriteLine($"person:3 new age: {newAge}");
</code>


<h2>Retrieve a Field from Hash</h2>

<p>
    Retrieving a field from a hash is simple. All you need to do is use the <code>HashGet</code> method, passing in the key and 
    field you want to get.
</p>

<code>
    var person1Name = db.HashGet(person1, "name");
    Console.WriteLine($"person:1 name: {person1Name}");
</code>

<h2>Get All Fields From a Hash</h2>

<p>
    There are two ways to retrieve all the fields from a hash. Which one is appropriate to use is dependent on how large your hash is.
    If your hash is relatively small, in Redis Terms this means less than 1000 fields. You can use <code>HashGetAll</code>. If you are working
    with a very large hash with many thousands of fields, you may want to use HashScan instead. HashScan, allows you to paginate over your hash.
    This will decrease the amount of time that Redis is busy servicing any one request, but will require multiple round trips to Redis.    
</p>

<h3>HashGetAll</h3>

<code>
    var person2Fields = db.HashGetAll(person2);
    Console.WriteLine($"person:2 fields: {string.Join(", ", person2Fields)}");
</code>

<h3>HashScan</h3>

<code>
    var person3Fields = db.HashScan(person3);
    Console.WriteLine($"person:3 fields: {string.Join(", ", person3Fields)}");
</code>
