<h1>Hands-On with Redis Streams</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Redis Streams from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <code>/src/section_2/section2.6/section2.6.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Collect and Clean Out Stream Keys</h2>

<p>
    During this exercise we'll be creating streams for two different sensors. We'll call them <i>sensor:1</i> and <i>sensor:2</i>. Our first
    task, so that we can run this app repeatedly and predictably, will be to initialize those keys, clear out those sensor's current stream state.
</p>

<code>
    var sensor1 = "sensor:1";
    var sensor2 = "sensor:2";

    db.KeyDelete(new RedisKey[]{sensor1, sensor2});
</code>

<h2>Adding Items to a Stream</h2>

<p>
    Adding an item to a stream is as simple as calling <code>StreamAdd</code>. However, for the purposes of this example we are going to do
    something a bit different. We are going to be dispatching all of our StreamAdd/StreamRead methods in tasks that will continually push/poll
    results from Redis. We'll have a <code>Console.ReadKey</code> at the end to allow you to terminate the program by pressing any key.
</p>

<p>
    So, for our StreamAdd Operation we will, in an endless loop, produce new messages every second. Now, so that there's some variation,
    every five seconds we'll try to increment or decrement the temperature and humidity picked up by the sensor by 1.
</p>

<code>
    var rnd = new Random();
    Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        long numInserted = 0;
        var s1Temp = 28;
        var s2Temp = 5;
        var s1Humid = 35;
        var s2Humid = 87;
        while (true)
        {
            await db.StreamAddAsync(sensor1, new[]
            {
                new NameValueEntry("temp", s1Temp),
                new NameValueEntry("humidity", s1Humid)
                
            });

            await db.StreamAddAsync(sensor2, new[]
            {
                new NameValueEntry("temp", s2Temp),
                new NameValueEntry("humidity", s2Humid)
            });

            await Task.Delay(1000);

            numInserted++;
            if (numInserted % 5 == 0)
            {
                s1Temp = s1Temp + rnd.Next(3) - 2;
                s2Temp = s2Temp + rnd.Next(3) - 2;
                s1Humid = Math.Min(s1Humid + rnd.Next(3) - 2, 100);
                s2Humid = Math.Min(s2Humid + rnd.Next(3) - 2, 100);
            }
        }
    });


    //put all your future code above here!
    Console.ReadKey();
</code>

<h2>Read from Stream</h2>

<p>
    To read from a Redis Stream, you'll need to specify a stream position for each stream you want to read. Then, you can pass in those
    stream positions to the StreamRead method, that will respond with a set of streams, each of which contains entries, if there are any
    messages in the stream to read from. It's important that after each stream read, that the stream position be updated, this prevents the
    reader from re-reading the same message over and over again.
</p>

<p>
    To accomplish all of this, add the following to just above the <code>Console.ReadKey()</code> at the bottom of the file.
</p>

<code>
    Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        var positions = new Dictionary<string, StreamPosition>
        {
            { sensor1, new StreamPosition(sensor1, "0-0") },
            { sensor2, new StreamPosition(sensor2, "0-0") }
        };
        
        while (true)
        {
            var readResults = await db.StreamReadAsync(positions.Values.ToArray(), countPerStream: 1);
            if (!readResults.Any(x => x.Entries.Any()))
            {
                await Task.Delay(1000);
                continue;
            }
            foreach (var stream in readResults)
            {
                foreach (var entry in stream.Entries)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"{stream.Key} - {entry.Id}: {string.Join(", ", entry.Values)}");
                    positions[stream.Key!] = new StreamPosition(stream.Key, entry.Id);
                }
            }
        }
    });
</code>

<h2>Consumer Groups</h2>

<p>
    Consumer Groups in Redis Streams allow for coordinated reads of messages across consumers. These consumers can operate independently of
    each other without having to worry about duplicate processing of the same messages.
</p>

<h3>Create a Consumer Group</h3>
<p>
    To Create a consumer group, you just need to call <code>StreamCreateConsumerGroup</code> passing in the stream key, the group name, and
    the starting position. We'll create an average consumer group. This will be responsible for maintaining a running average of the telemetry
    gotten from each sensor.
</p>

<code>
    db.StreamCreateConsumerGroup(sensor1, "average", "0-0");
    db.StreamCreateConsumerGroup(sensor2, "average", "0-0");
</code>

<h3>Read from a Consumer Group</h3>

<p>
    Reading from a consumer group is slightly different than reading without a consumer group. You user the <code>StreamReadGroup</code> method,
    and you do not have to keep track of the <i>Id</i> that you want to read from. Instead, you'll use the special <i>></i> id, which tells
    it to respond with the next message for that consumer group. We'll be monitoring average temperatures for each of our sensors, so naturally
    we'll need to keep track of how many messages we've seen so far, and the cumulative temperature observed.
</p>

<p>
    After we've finished processing the result of a stream message, we then need to acknowledge the message with Redis. This will allow Redis to
    remove the stream message from it's Pending Entries List(PEL).
</p>

<code>
    var groupName = "tempAverage";
db.StreamCreateConsumerGroup(sensor1, groupName, "0-0");
db.StreamCreateConsumerGroup(sensor2, groupName, "0-0");

Task.Run(async()=>
{
    var tempTotals = new Dictionary<string, double> { { sensor1, 0 }, { sensor2, 0 } };

    var messageCountTotals = new Dictionary<string, long>() { { sensor1, 0 }, { sensor2, 0 } };
    var consumerName = "consumer:1";
    var positions = new Dictionary<string, StreamPosition>
    {
        { sensor1, new StreamPosition(sensor1, ">") },
        { sensor2, new StreamPosition(sensor2, ">") }
    };
    
    while (true)
    {
        var result = await db.StreamReadGroupAsync(positions.Values.ToArray(), groupName, consumerName, countPerStream: 1);
        if (!result.Any(x => x.Entries.Any()))
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000);
            continue;
        }

        foreach (var stream in result)
        {
            foreach (var entry in stream.Entries)
            {
                var temp = (int)entry.Values.First(x => x.Name == "temp").Value;
                messageCountTotals[stream.Key!]++;
                tempTotals[stream.Key!] += temp;
                var avg = tempTotals[stream.Key!]/messageCountTotals[stream.Key!];
                Console.WriteLine($"{stream.Key} average Temp = {avg:0.###}");
                await db.StreamAcknowledgeAsync(stream.Key, groupName, entry.Id);
            }
        }
    }
});
