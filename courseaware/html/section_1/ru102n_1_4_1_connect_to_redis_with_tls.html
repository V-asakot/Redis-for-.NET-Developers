<h1>Connect to Redis with TLS</h1>

<p>
    An important feature of Redis Cloud, Redis Enterprise, and more recently with 
    Redis 6, is Transportation Layer Security (TLS). To learn more about how to use
    use TLS with Redis, see <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru330/">RU330: Redis Security</a>
    or the TLS article on <a href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/security/encryption/">redis.io</a>
</p>

<h2>.NET Framework vs .NET Core</h2>

<p>
    When it comes to connecting to Redis with TLS it's important that we differentiate
    between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Because of the difference in the 
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream">SSLStream</a>
    API in Framework vs Core, Core is substantially more configurable.
</p>

<h3>Configuring TLS in .NET Framework</h3>

<p>To configure TLS in the .NET Framework you have two options. You can either:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Set up the certificate selection and validation event handlers.</li>
    <li>Set up certificate/password environment variables.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Event handlers</h4>
<p>
    There are two event handlers that you can use with the <code>ConfigurationOptions</code>
    object to configure TLS. Neither of these can be used from a connection string
    so you must use the <code>ConfigurationOptions</code> if you need to use them
    
</p>

<p>
    The first of these is the <code>ConfigurationOptions.CertificateSelection</code> event handler.
    This event handler selects the certificate that you will use to authenticate
    with the Redis Server.
</p>

<code>
    configurationOptions.CertificateSelection += delegate 
    {
        var cert = new X509Certificate2(PATH_TO_CERT_FILE, "");
        return cert;
    };
</code>

<p>
    The other event handler is used to check the validity of the Redis Server's
    certificates the <code>ConfigurationOptions.CertificateValidation</code> handler.
</p>

<code>
    configurationOptions.CertificateValidation += (sender, certificate, chain, errors) =>
    {
        var isValid = true;
        // insert check certificate logic here
        return isValid;
    };
</code>

<h4>Environment Variables</h4>

<p>
    There are also two environment variables that the ConnectionMultiplexer will
    check if there is no certificate selection delegate set. This is useful if
    you are using a derivative library of StackExchange.Redis that does not provide
    direct access to the ConnectionOptions object.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>SERedis_ClientCertPfxPath</code>: provides the multiplexer the path to the certificate file.</li>
    <li><code>SERedis_ClientCertPassword </code>: Is the password for the certificate file if applicable.</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Connecting in .NET Core</h3>

 <p>
    In .NET Core (3.1, 5, 6, 7+) <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslclientauthenticationoptions">SslClientAuthenticationOptions</a>
    as added as an optional way of configuring an SslStream. This provides a great
    deal of extra flexibility when it comes to configuring TLS settings Redis.
