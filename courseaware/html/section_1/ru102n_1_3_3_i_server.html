<h1>The IServer</h1>

<p>
    The <code>IServer</code> is an abstraction to a single instance of a Redis Server. You can grab an instance of an <code>IServer</code>
    by using the <code>IConnectionMultiplexer.GetServer</code> command, passing in the exact endpoint information you want to
    retrieve. <code>IServer</code> has a fundamentally different role than IDatabase as you're to use it to handle the server
    level commands. That means that in general, data modeling commands are not appropriate to be used on a server. Rather
    operations like checking the server's info (the basic info of Redis), it's configuration, updating it's configuration,
    checking memory statistics, and the like are IServer operations. Even scanning for the keys of a Redis server should be
    done at the server level.
