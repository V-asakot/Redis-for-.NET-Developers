<h1>Connect to Redis Cluster</h1>

<p>
    Of the "advanced" Redis Connections cluster is probably the easiest to 
    understand. Connecting to an OSS Cluster instance is the same as connecting
    to a standalone Redis Instance. The only exception is that when you are
    listing endpoints, you'll want to use more than one. This is so that if
    the endpoint you are trying to reach has failed over, the Multiplexer
    still has a chance to connect to the other master instances.
