<h1>IConnectionMultiplexer</h1>

<p>
    The IConnectionMultiplexer is responsible for maintaining all of the
    connections to Redis. As I described in the previous section. It routes
    all the commands to Redis through a single connection for interactive commands,
    and a separate connection for subscription, which we'll discuss more in
    depth later.
