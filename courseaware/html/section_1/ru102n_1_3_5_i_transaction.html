<h1>ITransaction</h1>

<p>
    The ITransaction provides an interface for Redis <a href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/transactions/">Transactions</a>.
    Transactions in Redis differ from transactions in other database, for a full
    description of transactions check out the transaction section of
    <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/">RU101</a>.    
</p>

<p>
    The ITransaction interface is fundamentally an async interface. It exposes 
    a very similar command set to the IDatabase, but it will only expose async
    versions of each command. That is because each command in ITransaction is
    async, as they will not be competed until after Execute is called.

<p>
    You can get an instance of an ITransaction by calling 
    <code>IDatabase.GetTransaction()</code> on your <code>IDatabase</code> object.
