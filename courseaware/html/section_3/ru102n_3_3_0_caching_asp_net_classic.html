<h1>Caching in ASP.NET</h1>

<p>
    Doing simple caching in ASP.NET is the only one of the use cases we'll discuss here that does not involve the use of some derived library.
    It's a simple enough way to use Redis that one isn't particularly needed (though when we look at doing this with ASP.NET Core you'll see
    why a framework integration can be really nice.)
