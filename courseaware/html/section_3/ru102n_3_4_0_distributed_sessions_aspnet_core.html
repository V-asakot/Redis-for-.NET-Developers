<h1>Distributed Session State in ASP.NET Core</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Session State Management in ASP.NET.
    You'll likely want to open up the csproj file and checkout the <i>starting-point</i>
    before proceeding, unless of course you'd prefer to build everything from scratch
    the csproj file is located at  <code>/src/section_3/section3.5/section3.5.csproj</code> 
    it's highly recommended that you use Visual Studio or Rider for this Hands-On.

    Session state is the state maintained between the client's browser and a web server. However as we live in a world of increasingly larger
    distributed systems, we run into a problem. Do we really want the client to be dependent on a single, theoretically stateless application
    server? The answer is no, yet this session-state can be absolutely critical for the functionality of some applications. Hence it's often
    really helpful to have a intermediate database act as a central holder for this session state. This pattern is so popular in fact that it's
    heavily integrated into both ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, and since Redis is so often tapped as the database acting as the distributed session
    state store, there are very straight-forward integrations to add Redis as a native integration which we'll be exploring throughout the next
    couple of sections.
