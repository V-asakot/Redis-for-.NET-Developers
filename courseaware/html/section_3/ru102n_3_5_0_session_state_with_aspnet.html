<h1>Distributed Session State with ASP.NET</h1>

<p>
    ASP.NET has a well established Distributed Session State Provider for Redis called <code>Microsoft.Web.RedisSessionStateProvider</code>,
    it allows for a proper Integration of Session State with Redis, and similar to the ASP.NET Core case, is quite easy to get up and running with.
</p>

<p>
    In this section, we'll be walking through a very simple application that leverage Session State, and see how to add Redis as a Provider of
    distributed session state in ASP.NET.
</p>

<p>
    Because this is ASP.NET, this section is considered optional, none of the questions on the final will be derived from the material from this
    section. However, if you still work on non-core ASP.NET apps, this can still be quite useful, so if it's useful to you, I'd encourage you 
    to walk through this tutorial.
