<h1>Hands-On Caching with ASP.NET</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Caching in ASP.NET.
    You'll likely want to open up the csproj file and checkout the <i>starting-point</i>
    before proceeding, unless of course you'd prefer to build everything from scratch
    the csproj file is located at  <code>/src/section_3/section3.3/section3.3.csproj</code> 
    it's highly recommended that you use Visual Studio or Rider for this Hands-On.
</p>

<h2>Migrate the Database</h2>

<p>
    The first thing to be done is of course migrate the database to where we need it to be. In this step we'll create the database files,
    create the tables, and seed some data into the database. To do this, all you'll need to do is in the Package Manager Console run:
</p>

<code>
    update-database
</code>

<h2>Create our Lazy Multiplexer</h2>

<p>
    Unlike ASP.NET Core, dependency injection is not exactly a given in ASP.NET, there are competing modes of handling dependency injection,
    but to simplify our example we'll be using a Lazy Multiplexer. In the file <code>Redis.cs</code>, add the following code to the Redis class:
</p>

<code>
    private static readonly Lazy<ConnectionMultiplexer> LazyMuxer;

    static Redis()
    {
        var options = new ConfigurationOptions
        {
            EndPoints = { "localhost:6379" },
            Password = ""
        };

        LazyMuxer = new Lazy<ConnectionMultiplexer>(() => ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(options));
    }

    public static ConnectionMultiplexer Muxer => LazyMuxer.Value;
    public static IDatabase Database => Muxer.GetDatabase();
</code>

<p>
    This will create the Multiplexer the first time it's referenced in our app, and provides a static way of accessing a single multiplexer
    throughout our application.
</p>

<h2>Caching Average Sale</h2>

<p>
    Unlike the ASP.NET Core example, we need to make use of the ConnectionMultiplexer and it's methods directly and leverage the core Redis
    API. We can approximate what behavior pretty easily using the <code>StringGet</code> and <code>StringSet</code> methods that we explored
    earlier in this course. Find the <i>// TODO Section 3.3 step 1</i> mark in <i>AverageController.cs</i> and add the following bit.
</p>

<code>
    var db = Redis.Database;
    var avg = (double?)await db.StringGetSetExpiryAsync($"average:{id}", TimeSpan.FromHours(1));
    if(avg != null)
    {
        stopwatch.Stop();
        return Ok(new Dictionary<string, double>
        {
            {"average", avg.Value },
            {"elapsed", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds }
        });
    }
</code>

<p>
    This will check the cache, and if the average has already been computed, it will simply return the computed result. Using <code>StringGetSetExpiry</code>
    has the added effect of resetting the expiration for more frequently accessed averages.
</p>

<p>
    Now, if we fail to find the average for the given employee, we'll need to compute it from our SQL database, just as we did in the previous
    example. After computing that, we'll use a simple <code>StringSet</code> to set the key and the expiration. Find the <i>// TODO Section 3.3 step 2</i>
    mark, and add the following to set the field in the cache, along with an expiration of an hour.
</p>

<code>
    await db.StringSetAsync($"average:{id}", avg, TimeSpan.FromHours(1));
</code>

<h2>Caching our Top Salesperson</h2>

<p>
    For our Top Salesperson aggregation we have two keys that we're working with so our gets/sets will look slightly different. For the StringGet
    we will pass an array of keys, and unpack from the resultant <code>RedisValue[]</code> array. Find the <i>// TODO Section 3.3 step 3</i> mark
    and add the following to do just that.
</p>

<code>
    var res = await db.StringGetAsync(new RedisKey[] { "top:sales", "top:name" });
    long? topSales = (long?)res[0];
    string topSalesName = res[1];
    if(topSales.HasValue && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(topSalesName))
    {
        stopwatch.Stop();
        return Ok(new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { "sum_sales", topSales },
            { "employee_name", topSalesName },
            { "time", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds }
        });
    }
</code>

<p>
    Now, if we haven't run this calculation in the last 5 minutes, we'll have had a cache-miss. In which case, we'll run the same calculation we
    did in the ASP.NET Core example, after which, we'll set the two relevant keys, along with a 5 minute expiration <code>TimeSpan</code>. We
    don't want to make multiple round trips to Redis, so we'll collect the dispatched tasks and await them. Find the <i>// TODO Section 3.3 step 4</i>
    mark and add the following.
</p>

<code>
    var topSalesSetTask = db.StringSetAsync("top:sales", topSalesperson.sumSales, expiry: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
    var topNameSetTask = db.StringSetAsync("top:name", topSalesperson.Employee.Name, expiry: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
    await Task.WhenAll(topSalesSetTask, topNameSetTask);
</code>

<h2>Cache Total Sales</h2>

<p>
    The last aggregation we'll look at here is the Total Sales Aggregation, we want this to expire this at the same time everyday (local midnight)
    of the next day. Thus we'll start off in the <i>Controllers/TotalSalesController.cs</i>'s <code>GetTotalSales</code> method's <i>// TODO Section 3.3 step 5</i>
    and add our normal check:
</p>

<code>
    long? totalSales = (long?) await db.StringGetAsync("totalSales");
    if(totalSales != null)
    {
        return Ok(new Dictionary<string, long>()
        {
            { "Total Sales", totalSales.Value },
            { "elapsed", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds }
        });
    }
</code>

<p>
    Then, after the <i>// TODO Section 3.3 step 6</i> mark, you can add the following - to have it cache the result, and set an expiration of
    the local midnight:
</p>

<code>
    var timeTillMidnight = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1) - DateTime.Now;
    await db.StringSetAsync("totalSales", totalSales, timeTillMidnight);
</code>

<h2>Run the App</h2>

<p>
    All That's left to do now is to run the app. To do that, hit F5 in Visual Studio or Rider, and it will launch the app. Once it's running,
    you can visit the app at <a href="http://localhost:50239/">http://localhost:50239/</a> and you can look at the result of our code at the
    following links:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Total Sales: <a href="http://localhost:50239/api/totalsales">http://localhost:50239/api/totalsales</a></li>
    <li>Average: <a href="http://localhost:50239/api/average/1">http://localhost:50239/api/average/1</a></li>
    <li>Total Sales: <a href="http://localhost:50239/api/topsalesperson">http://localhost:50239/api/topsalesperson</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    And you'll notice of course that after the initial load of each, that there's a significant increase in performance as the cache is hit
    rather than the database.
</p>
