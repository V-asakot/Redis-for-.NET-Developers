<h1>Caching in ASP.NET Core</h1>

<p>
    Using Redis as a Cache in ASP.NET Core is as simple as using the Distributed Cache API that's available for any manor of cache that you
    might use in ASP.NET Core. The only change that occurs when you add Redis to your Cache's in ASP.NET Core is that ASP.NET core will
    use Redis as it's cache provider. The remainder of the operations are abstracted away from us so we don't have to think about it. That
    means that fundamentally, the feature set provided by the Redis Cache Provider is limited to the <code>IDistributedCache</code> API.

    In this section we'll be encountering our Employee Aggregation System for the first time, where we'll use a simple model, and running some
    aggregations against a SQLite database with Entity Framework to see how one might use a caching framework to remove the need to repeat
    major computation.
