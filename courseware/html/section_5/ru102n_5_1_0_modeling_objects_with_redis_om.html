<h1>Modeling Objects with Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    Redis OM .NET gives you the ability to natively model your objects in Redis. Let's start off with the model that we will use for the
    remainder of this course. It will look very similar to the model that we used in Unit 3, but with some important changes:
</p>

<code>
    public class Employee
    {
        public string? Id { get; set; }
        public List&lt;string&gt;? Sales { get; set; }
        public Address? Address { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }        
        public int Age { get; set; }
    }

    public class Sale
    {
        public string? Id { get; set; }
        public int Total { get; set; }
        public Address? Address { get; set; }
    }

    public class Address
    {
        public string? StreetAddress { get; set; }
        public string? PostalCode { get; set; }
        public GeoLoc Location { get; set; }
        public Address? ForwardingAddress { get; set; }
    }
</code>

<p>
    In the examples for the remainder of this course, this model will be found in <i>Model.cs</i>, and will need to be imported into <i>Program.cs</i>
    before being used. In this section, we'll learn how to take this model, and turn it into something that can be stored and
    queried in Redis.
</p>

<h2>The Document Attribute</h2>

<p>
    The <code>DocumentAttribute</code> is the primary attribute for a class, it's meant to decorate the class definition directly.
    It defines a few things with regards to how Redis OM will store and index a document inserted into Redis. The <code>DocumentAttribute</code>
    need only decorate a class that will be inserted into Redis, it does not need to decorate classes that will be embedded within the
    documents that we are inserting. In our example, the only class we'll be inserting is the <code>Employee</code> and <code>Sale</code> class, the
    <code>Address</code> will be embedded within it. With the <code>DocumentAttribute</code> we define the parameters of the class. This includes the
    following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Storage Type</li>
    <li>Key prefix</li>
    <li>Index Name</li>
    
</ul>

<h3>Storage Type</h3>

<p>
    Redis OM has two ways of storing documents, as JSON and as Hashes. It's highly recommended that you use JSON, unless there's some 
    compelling reason not to do so. JSON is better at storing more complicated objects, particularly collections within those objects.
</p>

<h3>Key Prefix</h3>

<p>
    The Key Prefix is expressed as a collection of potential prefixes that keys inserted into Redis can hold. When the index is created
    later this will limit what redis will index to keys matching the given prefix. During key-generation at insertion time, if the <code>Prefixes</code> array is set, Redis OM will select the first prefix
    and use that as the prefix for all inserted keys. If no prefixes are set, Redis OM will use the fully qualified class name as the 
    prefix for keys when it inserts your documents into Redis.
</p>

<h3>Index Name</h3>

<p>
    The Index Name is the name of the index in Redis. An index is the construct that will allow us to query records by their values later
    with LINQ, the Index Name has an easily computable name if not set (&lt;lowercaseclassname&gt;-idx) so it's not critical at all that
    this be set, but if you care what your index is called, you may set this.
</p>

<h2>The Redis Id Field Attribute</h2>

<p>
    The <code>RedisIdFieldAttribute</code> marks the Id Field for the model. There should only be one of these per class, on the top level
    class being stored. This Id Field is attached to at storage time. If there is an ID present, then the Id that's in that field is respected
    and used during key generation, if it's empty, then Redis OM sets it based off the Id Generation Strategy, which can be changed in
    the <code>DocumentAttribute</code>, and by default will use a ULID. It's recommended that the Id Field be either a <code>string</code>, 
    <code>Ulid</code>, or <code>Guid</code>, unless you provide a generation strategy, or supply the ID itself when creating the classes for insertion.
</p>

<h2>The Indexed Attribute</h2>

<p>
    The <code>IndexedAttribute</code> is the workhorse attribute of Redis OM, it can be applied to most types, strings, enums, numerics,
    <code>GeoLoc</code>, and even other classes. The <code>IndexedAttribute</code> tells Redis OM that you want to be able to query the field, or
    in the case of other classes - sub-fields of those classes. The <code>IndexedAttribute</code> allows you to mark fields as sortable,
    and for more complex documents allows you to specify either how far down the object tree the indexing will cascade, or the exact paths
    you want to search on.
</p>


<h2>The Searchable Attribute</h2>

<p>
    The <code>SearchableAttribute</code> enables full-text search on a string field stored in Redis. If an attribute is marked as searchable,
    <i>==</i> operations in LINQ will be tantamount to asking for a match against the Full Text Search field rather than an exact match.
