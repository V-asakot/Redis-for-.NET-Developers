<h1>Hands-On with Redis Scripts</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Prepared Lua Scripts from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <code>/src/section_2/section2.7/section2.7.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Preparing Scripts</h2>

<p>
    Prepared Scripts allow you to parameterize your scripts in a way that just isn't possible with traditional lua scripts. In a prepared
    lua script, you can use the <b>@</b> symbol to denote an identifier that will be substituted when the script is called. You can then
    pass in objects with your named parameters. StackExchange.Redis will then differentiate what goes in through the <i>KEYS</i> array versus
    the <i>ARGV</i> array based on the type provided for the parameter. All <i>RedisKey</i> values will be treated as keys, and thus used
    to determine which shard to execute the script against. Let's take a look at a simple script that will auto-increment an id based off 
    of an id key that's stored in Redis, and use that Id to create the key for the value that we're inserting.
</p>

<code>
    var scriptText = @"
        local id = redis.call('incr', @id_key)
        local key = 'key:' .. id
        redis.call('set', key, @value)
        return key
    ";

    var script = LuaScript.Prepare(scriptText);

    var key1 = db.ScriptEvaluate(script, new {id_key=(RedisKey)"autoIncrement", value="A String Value"});
    var key2 = db.ScriptEvaluate(script, new {id_key=(RedisKey)"autoIncrement", value="Another String Value"});

    Console.WriteLine($"Key 1: {key1}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Key 2: {key2}");

</code>

<p>
    Notice how in the anonymous constructor we're using to create the parameters <code>id_key</code> is being cast to a <code>RedisKey</code>.
    This will make that key go through the <i>KEYS</i> array, and it will use that key when determining which shard to execute against. Keep in 
    mind that in the context of this script we are dynamically creating a key in the script. In a clustered environment, you would want to make
    sure that you are using hashtags to ensure that the key belongs on the shard that the script is being run on, the script has been simplified
    for demonstration purposes. If you'd like to learn more about sharding and hashtags check out <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru301/">RU301: Running Redis at Scale</a>.
