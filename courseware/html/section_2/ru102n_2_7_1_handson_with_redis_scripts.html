<h1>Hands-On with Redis Scripts</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Prepared Lua Scripts from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <span class="code">/src/section_2/section2.7/section2.7.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Preparing Scripts</h2>

<p>
    Prepared Scripts allow you to parameterize your scripts in a way that just isn't possible with traditional Lua scripts.
</p>
<p> 
    In a prepared
    Lua script, you can use the <span class="code"><b>@</b></span> symbol to denote an identifier that will be substituted when the script is called. You can then
    pass in objects with your named parameters. StackExchange.Redis will then differentiate what goes in through the <span class="code"><i>KEYS</i></span> array versus
    the <span class="code"><i>ARGV</i></span> array based on the type provided for the parameter. All <span class="code"><i>RedisKey</i></span> values will be treated as keys, and thus used
    to determine which shard to execute the script against. 
</p>
<p>
    Let's take a look at a simple script that will auto-increment an id based off 
    of an id key that's stored in Redis, and use that Id to create the key for the value that we're inserting.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var scriptText = @"
        local id = redis.call('incr', @id_key)
        local key = 'key:' .. id
        redis.call('set', key, @value)
        return key
    ";

    var script = LuaScript.Prepare(scriptText);

    var key1 = db.ScriptEvaluate(script, new {id_key=(RedisKey)"autoIncrement", value="A String Value"});
    var key2 = db.ScriptEvaluate(script, new {id_key=(RedisKey)"autoIncrement", value="Another String Value"});

    Console.WriteLine($"Key 1: {key1}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Key 2: {key2}");

</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how in the anonymous constructor we're using to create the parameters <span class="code">id_key</span> is being cast to a <span class="code">RedisKey</span>.
    This will make that key go through the <span class="code"><i>KEYS</i></span> array, and it will use that key when determining which shard to execute against. Keep in 
    mind that in the context of this script we are dynamically creating a key in the script. In a clustered environment, you would want to make
    sure that you are using hashtags to ensure that the key belongs on the shard that the script is being run on, the script has been simplified
    for demonstration purposes.

<h2>Non-Prepared Script</h2>

<p>
    With a non-prepared scripts the process is more compliant with the original Lua Scripting API, instead of using <span class="code"><b>@</b></span>
    to mark your keys and values, you use <span class="code">KEYS</span> and <span class="code">ARGV</span> to deploy your keys
    and arguments respectively. Then you pass in an array of type <span class="code">RedisKey</span> for the <span class="code">KEYS</span> and
    an array of type <span class="code">RedisValue</span> for <span class="code">ARGV</span>. Add the following code:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    var nonPreparedScript = @"
        local id = redis.call('incr', KEYS[1])
        local key = 'key:' .. id
        redis.call('set', key, ARGV[1])
        return key
    ";

    var key3 = db.ScriptEvaluate(nonPreparedScript, new RedisKey[] { "autoIncrement" }, new RedisValue[] { "Yet another string value" });
    Console.WriteLine($"Key 3: {key3}");
</pre>

<p>
    The logic here is equivalent to the previous example in that the script does the same thing, the key difference is that you do not have to map
    an anonymous type for your parameters.
