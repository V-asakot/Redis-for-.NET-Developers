<h1>Hands on With Redis Transactions</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Redis Transactions from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <code>/src/section_2/section2.8/section2.8.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    Redis transactions operate in a similar way to the way that Batches operate with two big caveats.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>All commands under a Redis Transaction will be sent to Redis at the same time, as opposed to traditional transactions where commands can be sent in multiple round trips.</li>
    <li>You cannot watch keys in a StackExchange.Redis transactions. But: you can add conditions to the transaction that will prevent the transaction from moving forward in certain conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Simple Transaction</h2>

<p>
    Before we get into anything complex. Let's take a look at a simple transaction. Imagine we wanted to add a simple person hash to Redis.
    But in addition to adding the simple person hash, we also wanted to add some secondary indexes to it, keep in mind that we will explore 
    in later sections <b>SIGNIFICANTLY</b> more effective ways to index your data in Redis, but old-style OSS secondary indexing provides a great
    illustration of transactions. Anyway, we have a person hash with three fields, name, age, and postal code and we will index all three fields.
    So that our data is consistent, we want to add the hash and update all the indexes at the same time. This is a perfect place for transactions
    as all the commands will execute in isolation. We can do all this by initializing an <code>ITransaction</code> with <code>db.CreateTransaction</code>.
    We can then execute commands against that transaction, and close it out with <code>Execute</code>.
</p>

<code>
    var transaction = db.CreateTransaction();

    transaction.HashSetAsync("person:1", new HashEntry[]
    {
        new ("name", "Steve"),
        new ("age", 32),
        new ("postal_code", "32999")
    });
    transaction.SortedSetAddAsync("person:name:Steve", "person:1", 0);
    transaction.SortedSetAddAsync("person:postal_code:32999", "person:1", 0);
    transaction.SortedSetAddAsync("person:age", "person:1", 32);

    var success = transaction.Execute();
    Console.WriteLine($"Transaction Successful: {success}");
</code>

<h2>Add a Condition to a Transaction</h2>

<p>
    Redis Transactions typically allow you to watch a key to see if the key has been touched at all while the transaction was being created
    and fleshed out. Due to the multiplexed nature of StackExchange.Redis, this isn't something that can be done practically as multiple
    transaction's watches can be interleaved with each other. However, what StackExchange.Redis does allow is for is for you to add conditions
    that must be satisfied in order for the transaction to complete. Let's try this out.
</p>

<p>
    Say that we want our person's age to be incremented to 33, but we want to confirm that the person's age before the transaction executes is
    in fact what we think it is, 32, we can add a condition to the transaction. Then, when the transaction executes, it will set the watch on
    Redis, query the hash, check the condition, and only if the condition passes, execute the transaction. Naturally if the state changes in
    the interim, the key is being watched, so the transaction will simply fail to execute once dispatched.
</p>

<code>
    transaction.AddCondition(Condition.HashEqual("person:1", "age", 32));
    transaction.HashIncrementAsync("person:1", "age");
    transaction.SortedSetIncrementAsync("person:age", "person:1", 1);

    success = transaction.Execute();
    Console.WriteLine($"Transaction Successful: {success}");
</code>

<h2>Failed Transactions conditions</h2>

<p>
    There are a couple of reasons that a transaction could fail to complete. If between the watch was added, and the when the transaction is
    transmitted to Redis, another command comes along and touches the watched key(s), then the transaction will fail to execute. Additionally
    if you set a condition in the transaction, and the condition proves false, it will fail to execute. In both cases, the <code>transaction.Execute</code>
    will respond with false to indicate that the transaction did not succeed. Let's try getting this to fail by setting the condition to something
    we know to be false, e.g. the age we just incremented to 33 is 31.
</p>

<code>
    transaction.AddCondition(Condition.HashEqual("person:1", "age", 31));
    transaction.HashIncrementAsync("person:1", "age");
    transaction.SortedSetIncrementAsync("person:age", "person:1", 1);
    success = transaction.Execute();

    Console.WriteLine($"Transaction Successful: {success}");
</code>

<p>
    In this case, the transaction will simply fail, and return false when executed.
