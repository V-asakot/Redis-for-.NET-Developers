<h1>The Ad-Hoc API</h1>

<p>
    The Ad-Hoc API exposed by StackExchange.Redis is a powerful tool that allows you to execute Arbitrary commands against Redis. Each of the
    Redis-Stack libraries we'll be looking at in the forth-coming sections use this Ad-Hoc API to execute commands against Redis and to parse
    their results. In this section we'll look at how to run ad-hoc commands against Redis, Parse their Results, and we'll use these ad-hoc
    commands to work with some of the Probabilistic Data Structures in Redis.
