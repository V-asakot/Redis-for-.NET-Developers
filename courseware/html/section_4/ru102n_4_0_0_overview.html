<h1>Redis Stack and the Ad-Hoc API</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to Unit 4 of RU102N, in this section we'll be taking a deeper look at Redis Stack.
</p>

<p>
    Redis Stack, what we've been using throughout this course thus far, is a more powerful version of Redis that bundles together a variety 
    of powerful data-structures and data modeling processes to dramatically enhance Redis. Some features available in Redis Stack include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Probabilistic Data Structures</li>
    <li>The ability to ingest and query Time Series Data</li>
    <li>The ability to create and Query Graph data models with Cypher query language</li>
    <li>The ability to store and retrieve serialized JSON documents directly</li>
    <li>The ability to Query across hashes and JSON Documents</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Unit 4 will focus on the first three, while Unit 5 will focus exclusively on the last two. We'll explore the client-ecosystem
    surrounding Redis Stack, and how you can leverage the ad-hoc API provided by StackExchange.Redis to execute any command you need to
    against Redis.
